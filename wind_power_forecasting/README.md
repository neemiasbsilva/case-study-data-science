# Case Study: Wind Power Forecasting

## About

This case study has the goal to solve wind power forecasting, using various weather, turbine, and rotor features. For this case specific we got data recorded from January
2018 till March 2020. The dataset can be found in 
[Wind Power Forecasting - Kaggle Competion](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/theforcecoder/wind-power-forecasting). This experiment was based in the [follow tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jicksy/wind-power-forecasting-using-tensorflow), but change the architecture of deep learning.
