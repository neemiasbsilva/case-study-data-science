## About

This case study has the purpose for build an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model for predict the probability of each customer leaving the bank. For this specific case we got 10K customers observations (samples) and we use their features. The features can be described as follow:

- Customer Id;
- Surname;
- Credit Score;
- Country;
- Gender;
- Age;
- Tenure;
- Balance;
- Amount of Products;
- Hash Credit Card;
- Estimated Salary.
