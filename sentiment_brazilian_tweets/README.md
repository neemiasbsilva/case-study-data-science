# Mult-Sentiment Detection in Brazilian Tweets

# Overview

This case study has the purpose build a machine learning model for classify the sentiment of brazillian tweets in positive, negative or neutral. 
The dataset can be access in [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/augustop/portuguese-tweets-for-sentiment-analysis). About the collection method,
the author used two, the first one was based in the Go et al. (2009) [[1](https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/people/alecmgo/papers/TwitterDistantSupervision09.pdf)]. 
The idea behind this paper is to use for collect samples with positive and negative tweets. Another method is to collect the neutral samples (Kouloumpis et al. (2011))
